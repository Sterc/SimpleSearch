![SimpleSearch version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.1.0-blue.svg) ![MODX Extra by Sterc](https://img.shields.io/badge/checked%20by-sterc-ff69b4.svg) ![MODX version requirements](https://img.shields.io/badge/modx%20version%20requirement-2.0%2B-brightgreen.svg)

## Installation
Simply install it through the top menu ```Extras > Installer``` and search for ```SimpleSearch```. Install it from there. After installing it, it is recommended to clear your MODX cache, through the top menu ```Manage > Clear Cache```.

## Upgrade risks
First of all: ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE UPDATING! 

Upgrading to 2.0.0 from 1.* is highly recommended, but it does introduce some risks.

Important changes from 1.* to 2.0.0:
- The namespace has been changed from `sisea` to `simplesearch`. If you're using custom System Settings, then please migrate them.
- The placeholder prefix has also been changed from `sisea` to `simplesearch`.
- The ElasticSearch and SOLR drivers have been removed, because they were in need of improvements. Future drivers should be seperate addons. Feel free to ask us for help here.

## Autosuggest
A processor has been provided for retrieving a list of search suggestions based on a Template Variable containing a comma delimited list of search terms. 
You can configure the TV to use by setting `simplesearch.autosuggest_tv`, which can either be the TV name or id.

You can use the example (requires jQuery) code below for retrieving a list of search suggestions.

```javascript
$('.simplesearch-search-form input[type="text"]').on('keyup', function () {
    var value = $(this).val();

    $.ajax({
        url         : '/assets/components/simplesearch/connector.php?action=web/autosuggestions&search=' + value,
        dataType    : 'JSON',
        complete    : function (result) {
            console.log(result.results);
        }
    });
});
```
